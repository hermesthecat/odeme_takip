## 2025-02-25 - Default Dates for Savings Modal
**Context:** Need to improve user experience in savings creation by setting sensible default dates
**Decision:** Implement automatic date defaults in the savings modal
- Start date: Current date
- Target date: One year from current date
**Rationale:** 
- Reduces user input friction
- Provides reasonable default timeline for savings goals
- Current date is logical starting point
- One year is a common timeframe for financial goals
**Implementation:** Added JavaScript initialization code in savings.js to set these defaults when the modal is opened
