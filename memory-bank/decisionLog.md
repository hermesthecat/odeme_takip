# Architecture Decision Log

## [2025-02-25] - Frontend Architecture Analysis

### Frontend Implementation Strategy
**Context:** Detailed analysis of frontend codebase (app.js, payments.js, savings.js)
**Observations:**
- jQuery and Bootstrap-based implementation
- Modular JavaScript organization
- Consistent patterns across features

**Key Architecture Decisions:**

1. Component Structure
   **Decision:** Use function-based components with consistent patterns
   **Rationale:**
   - Maintainable code organization
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Consistent update patterns
   - Standardized error handling

2. Data Loading Strategy
   **Decision:** Implement progressive loading pattern
   **Rationale:**
   - Better initial page load performance
   - Reduced server load
   - Improved user experience
   - Component-specific data management

3. State Management
   **Decision:** Use URL-based state with window-level data store
   **Rationale:**
   - Simple but effective state management
   - Supports browser history
   - Easy state sharing between components
   - No additional library dependencies

4. UI/UX Implementation
   **Decision:** Standardized modal and progress patterns
   **Rationale:**
   - Consistent user experience
   - Reusable components
   - Clear visual feedback
   - Maintainable UI code

5. Error Handling
   **Decision:** Centralized error management with user-friendly notifications
   **Rationale:**
   - Consistent error presentation
   - Improved user experience
   - Easier maintenance
   - Better error tracking

### Security Architecture
**Context:** Analysis of frontend security measures
**Observations:**
- XSS prevention utilities
- CSRF protection
- Input validation
- Session management

**Key Decisions:**
1. Input Sanitization
   - HTML escaping for user input
   - Validation before submission
   - Server-side verification

2. Authentication Flow
   - Token-based authentication
   - Session timeout handling
   - Secure credential management

### Internationalization Architecture
**Context:** Analysis of language support implementation
**Observations:**
- Comprehensive language file structure
- Translation key system
- Format handling for numbers and dates

**Key Decisions:**
1. Translation Management
   - Structured translation files
   - Dynamic message loading
   - Consistent key naming

2. Format Handling
   - Locale-aware number formatting
   - Date formatting standardization
   - Currency display conventions

## Future Architecture Decisions Needed

### 1. Frontend Optimization
**Context:** Current implementation shows areas for improvement
**Options to Consider:**
- Module bundling implementation
- Asset optimization strategy
- Cache management approach
- Code splitting strategy

### 2. State Management Evolution
**Context:** Current state management may need scaling
**Options to Consider:**
- State management library adoption
- Custom state management solution
- Event-driven architecture enhancement

### 3. Testing Strategy
**Context:** Testing approach needs definition
**Options to Consider:**
- Unit testing framework selection
- Integration testing approach
- E2E testing implementation
- Test coverage requirements

### 4. Build Process Implementation
**Context:** Build process needs optimization
**Options to Consider:**
- Module bundler selection
- Asset pipeline optimization
- Development workflow improvement
- Deployment strategy enhancement

## Open Questions
1. Cache invalidation strategy
2. State management scaling
3. Build process optimization
4. Testing framework selection
5. Performance monitoring approach
