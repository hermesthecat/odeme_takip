# Architecture Decision Log

## [2025-02-25] - Frontend Architecture Analysis

### Frontend Framework Choice
**Context:** Analysis of the frontend implementation
**Observations:**
- jQuery-based implementation with Bootstrap
- Modular JavaScript organization
- Custom utility patterns

**Key Decisions Identified:**
1. Use of jQuery and Bootstrap
   - Provides robust DOM manipulation
   - Offers comprehensive UI components
   - Enables rapid development
   - Maintains broad browser compatibility

2. Data Loading Strategy
   - Initial core data load
   - Lazy loading for component data
   - Component-specific refresh patterns
   - URL-based state management

3. Form Handling Implementation
   - Centralized validation system
   - Rule-based validation approach
   - Standardized AJAX submissions
   - Consistent error handling

4. Security Measures
   - XSS prevention utilities
   - Token-based authentication
   - Session management
   - Input sanitization

### Database Architecture
**Context:** Review of existing database schema and relationships
**Observations:**
- Multi-currency support built into core tables
- Hierarchical structure for recurring transactions
- Comprehensive stock portfolio management
- Proper foreign key constraints and indexing

**Key Design Patterns:**
1. Currency handling:
   - Base currency per user
   - Exchange rate tracking
   - Rate application at transaction level

2. Recurring Transactions:
   - Self-referential relationships in payments and income
   - Frequency-based scheduling
   - Status tracking for each instance

3. Portfolio Management:
   - Real-time price tracking
   - Support for partial sales
   - Historical price recording

### Authentication System
**Context:** Analysis of user authentication implementation
**Observations:**
- Password hashing implemented (bcrypt)
- Remember-me token functionality
- Admin role support
- Theme preference per user

### Security Considerations
**Identified Patterns:**
- XSS prevention (dedicated xss.php file)
- Input validation layer (validate.php)
- Authentication middleware (auth.php)

## Open Architecture Questions
1. Caching strategy
2. API rate limiting implementation
3. Background job handling (for stock updates)
4. Session management details

## Future Decisions Needed
1. Frontend optimization strategy
   - Bundle optimization
   - Asset loading improvements
   - Cache implementation

2. Testing Implementation
   - Unit testing framework
   - Integration testing approach
   - E2E testing strategy

3. Performance optimization strategy
4. Data archival policy
5. Backup and recovery procedures
6. API versioning strategy
