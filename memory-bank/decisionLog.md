# Architecture Decision Log

## [2025-02-25] - Initial System Architecture Analysis

### Database Architecture
**Context:** Review of existing database schema and relationships
**Observations:**
- Multi-currency support built into core tables
- Hierarchical structure for recurring transactions (parent_id relationships)
- Comprehensive stock portfolio management
- Proper foreign key constraints and indexing

**Key Design Patterns:**
1. Currency handling:
   - Base currency per user
   - Exchange rate tracking
   - Rate application at transaction level

2. Recurring Transactions:
   - Self-referential relationships in payments and income
   - Frequency-based scheduling
   - Status tracking for each instance

3. Portfolio Management:
   - Real-time price tracking
   - Support for partial sales
   - Historical price recording

### Authentication System
**Context:** Analysis of user authentication implementation
**Observations:**
- Password hashing implemented (bcrypt)
- Remember-me token functionality
- Admin role support
- Theme preference per user

### Security Considerations
**Identified Patterns:**
- XSS prevention (dedicated xss.php file)
- Input validation layer (validate.php)
- Authentication middleware (auth.php)

## Open Architecture Questions
1. Caching strategy
2. API rate limiting implementation
3. Background job handling (for stock updates)
4. Session management details

## Future Decisions Needed
1. Performance optimization strategy
2. Data archival policy
3. Backup and recovery procedures
4. API versioning strategy
